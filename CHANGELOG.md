## [3.1.1] - 07.05.2021

* Removed possibly unnecessary reset of the watches on update of the widgets. If you experience any strange behaviour with this version, please let me know
## [3.1.0] - 05.05.2021

* Added new function to rebuild a widget as soon as a GetIt-Scope changed
### Trigger a rebuild on GetIt Scope changes
As it is possible that objects registered in a higher GetIt-Scope can shadow objects of the same registration type in a lower scope it is important to ensure that the UI can update its references to the newly active object (the one last registered).
The get_it_mixin detects such changes and updates them on the next rebuild but if you want to ensure that this happens immediately you can put a call to 

```dart
  /// Will triger a rebuild of the Widget if any new GetIt-Scope is pushed or popped
  /// This function will return `true` if the change was a push otherwise `false`
  /// If no change has happend the return value will be null
  bool? rebuildOnScopeChanges();
```
